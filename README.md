# BuildingControlCFD

This repository accompanies the paper:  
**_Data-driven operator learning for energy-efficient building control_**  
> The code will be made publicly available soon.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Access

We release our computational fluid dynamics (CFD) dataset on [Hugging Face ðŸ¤— Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/alwaysbyx/Bear-CFD-dataset).  
The dataset is designed to support research in **scientific machine learning**, especially for learning **neural operators** and **data-driven PDE solvers**.

### ðŸ”§ Dataset Details

- **Simulation Tool:** ANSYS FLUENT 2023R2  
- **Data Types:**  
  - Steady-state flow simulations  
  - Transient (time-dependent) flow simulations  
- **Domain:** Indoor air flow and COâ‚‚ concentration in ventilated building environments  
- **Applications:**  
  - Neural operator learning  
  - Spatiotemporal modeling  
  - Model-based control for HVAC systems

## ðŸ“œ License & Citation

The dataset and code are released for **research purposes only**.
